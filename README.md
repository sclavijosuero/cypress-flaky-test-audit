# cypress-flaky-test-audit

A Cypress plugin that tracks the order in which Cypress commands are entered into the command queue and delivers detailed, per-command analytics for your test runs, including execution order, timing, retries, and pass/fail outcomes. It helps identify flaky tests, performance bottlenecks, and commands that don’t execute, and presents audit results in the browser console, terminal output, and an HTML report with visual graphs of Cypress command execution across your test suite.
